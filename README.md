my notes while learning android Development with Java


There is a Java file for each screen and its corresponding xml file for view
Android Apps are built using MVC (model View Controller) Design pattern

### res Folder contains the public files

All static non executeable code lies in this folder,like images, or any other file that you want to inluce in the App

### manifests Folder contains the AndroidManifest.xml

this file contains the meta data of the App, minimum sdk, components, which information is required

### There are 3 kinds of files in the Android app (AndroidApp Project Structure)
  1- Source Files (Java Code Files)
  2- Resources Files
  3- COnfigurations Files
  
 ## My Questions
 
 How to navigate from one screen to other
